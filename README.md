# MusicHub Back-end - for the powerful online & offline music player

## ANNOUNCEMENT FOR DIVISION

Starting with this release [v0.4.0](https://github.com/MusicHubTS/backend/releases/tag/v0.4.0), the original ["MusicHub"](https://github.com/LittleYe233/MusicHub) repo is split into front-end and back-end part, which are included in project [MusicHub](https://github.com/MusicHubTS).

Below is README of the original repo, with partial changes to ensure that users can use both the new and old versions of it.

---

## Introduction

This project aims to standardize music experience and concentrate music resources on the Web which is available almost anytime and anywhere - with only a supported browser (you must have one nowadays).

It's a server-side app - it needs to be set up on a server, and it's recommended to spare sufficient disk space (and choose one outside China mainland if you want to enjoy music on some banned platforms).

It supports (or will support) plugins/addons for many other music platforms and custom themes.

## Getting started

### Source (recommended)

> **Important!** Ts.ED requires Node >= 14, Express >= 4 and TypeScript >= 4.

For Linux/OS X users, open your terminal and clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MusicHubTS/backend.git musichub-backend
```

Then change directory into it and choose the branch you want (main is recommended):

```bash
cd musichub-backend
git checkout main
```

Don't forget to copy configurations from example, or MusicHub will read built-in default settings:

```bash
cp config.example.yml config.yml
```

Note that git ignores `config.yml` by default, which is defined in `.gitignore`.

Now, follow the commands Ts.ED provided by default:

```batch
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve
$ npm run start

# build for production
$ npm run build
$ npm run start:prod
```

### NPM

**Note: The package has been published to NPM, but is not fully tested. It's just a placeholder.**

```bash
npm install @musichub/backend
```

### Docker

**Note: It's just a default method for running Ts.ED projects. It's not fully tested for this one. It's still recommended to use traditional source installation method.**

```bash
# build docker image
docker compose build

# start docker image
docker compose up
```

## Barrelsby (currently disabled)

**It's currently disabled. See commit [54a3b8b1982cacf73c994e6cabcfd0928b3b4a38](https://github.com/MusicHubTS/backend/commit/54a3b8b1982cacf73c994e6cabcfd0928b3b4a38) and issue [#1](https://github.com/MusicHubTS/backend/issues/1).**

This project uses [barrelsby](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barrelsby) to generate index files to import the controllers.

Edit `.barreslby.json` to customize it:

```json
{
  "directory": [
    "./src/controllers/rest",
    "./src/controllers/pages"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "__mock__",
    "__mocks__",
    ".spec.ts"
  ],
  "delete": false
}
```
